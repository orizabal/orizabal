### Hi, I'm Sam 👋🏽

I'm a second year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I was recently reimagining government services as a Full Stack Developer intern at the Ontario Digital Service. I've also supported a major digital transformation for Bell National Hosting Services to roll out Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) as a Full Stack Developer at Stratus360.

I am looking for internship opportunities for summer 2021! 👩🏽‍💻
