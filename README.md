### Hi, I'm Sam 👋🏽

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently reimagining government services as a Full Stack Developer intern at the Ontario Digital Service. I am also building a platform to host online fundraisers as a project developer with UW Blueprint.

I am looking for internship opportunities for summer 2021! 👩🏽‍💻
